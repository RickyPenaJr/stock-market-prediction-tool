## Project Description
A simple, user-friendly Python tool for predicting stock market prices by utilizing historical data, machine learning models, and clear visualizations to help predict how investments might perform in the future.

This project aims to provide investors, students, and financial analysts with a lightweight analytics pipeline that fetches real-time and historical stock data, cleans and stores it, runs predictive models, and visualizes trends through interactive graphs and dashboards.

## What This Project Does
✔ Fetches live and historical stock data using APIs (Yahoo Finance / Alpha Vantage)  
✔ Stores and organizes the data in a SQL database for long-term tracking  
✔ Trains machine learning models on historical price data to predict future closing prices  
✔ Displays clean visualizations of price trends and model predictions  
✔ Links to Power BI dashboards for high-level business intelligence reporting
